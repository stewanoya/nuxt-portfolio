    <h2 class="story__title">About me</h2>
    <p class="story__description">
      In the fall of 2021, I was in my 4th year as a classroom teacher. I had
      just earned my permanent contract -- a dream for any young educator, but I
      was left feeling like I had no control over my career.
      <br />
      <br />
      While teaching, I was also running a tech support side business I called
      <span>Tech Teacher</span>. I had a knack for technical problems, and
      enjoyed solving them. As my love for the space grew, I made the difficult
      choice to take a leave from teaching and pursue an opportunity in tech.
      <br />
      <br />
      In October, only a couple months after accepting my contract, I was
      enrolled in a coding bootcamp in Toronto - <span>Lighthouse Labs</span>.
      There I learned how little I actually knew, and how much more there was to
      explore. The days were long, the lessons moved quickly, and the
      assignments were plentiful. By the end of January 2022, I had graduated
      with so many more tools in my belt. Shortly after, in February of 2022, I
      was given an opportunity to work for Pathways To Education, a national
      non-profit serving kids in low socio-eoconmic areas across Canada, as a
      Junior Software Developer. It felt like the perfect bridge between my
      previous career and my future career.

      <br />
      <br />

      Now at Pathways I'm a part of a small team helping digitize their services
      and expand their impact through technology... and I
      <strong>love</strong> it.
